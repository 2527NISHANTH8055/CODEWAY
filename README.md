MOVIE GENRE CLASSIFICATION

This project presents a machine learning model designed to predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or other textual information. Leveraging techniques such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and various classifiers including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines, the model offers a versatile solution for genre classification in the realm of movie analysis.
